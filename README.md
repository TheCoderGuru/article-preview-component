## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Throughout this challenge, I learned how to manipulate the use of elements within the markup using ```min-width``` and ```max-width```.


### Continued development

In terms of continued development I plan to keep using the min-width and max-width properties in my development henceforth.
